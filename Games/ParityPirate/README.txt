Description:

Genre: Puzzle game
Aesthetics: Discovery, Fantasy, Challenge

Player must navigate levels looking for parity puzzles. Once a puzzle is found the player must complete said parity puzzle. There should be 3 puzzles per level. As levels progress difficulty should increase. There is currently one tutorial level and three main levels.

Installation Steps:

Import to UE4 version 4.14.3

Usage:

If HTML Doesn't work
Go to file -> export -> android -> ETC1
Wait
Connect tablet
Go to created folder and run install.bat
wait
Open app on tablet

Issues:

Doesn’t work for even size grids and non squares. Can’t generate more than one puzzle at a time. Speed is also an issue on tablets due to onTick methods. The door leading to the next level has no collision detection (can walk through without completing puzzles). Pressing buttons on a computer is set to the 1 key.

Future Plans:

Multi-stage levels, more challenging maze levels, levels with hazards to restart level(falling through open floors, traps, etc.), better artwork, more pirate themed objects, ideas, etc. (parrot to follow player around and give instructions, more ship like levels), add sounds(music, wooden peg walking sound, ocean sounds), pause menu code in project but not implemented.
